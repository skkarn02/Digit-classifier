I also provide a notebook in Notebook folder in which i build two model Multilayer preciptron and CNN and comapres both of them . 
I thanks Siraj raval for this amazing video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Bf3gl4hWY and this amazing repository https://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_deploy_a_keras_model_to_production from which I actually learn how to deploy keras model into production
